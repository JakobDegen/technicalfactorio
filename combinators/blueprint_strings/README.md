# Blueprint strings

Here you can find a collection of useful combinator components that have been
optimized by the technical factorio community to be as fast and compact as
(so far) possible.

Where possible, the blueprint strings are accompanied with short descriptions
of the functionality they provide, their inputs/outputs, and some other
documentation for their behavior.

If you would like to add to this list, feel free to open a PR. We appreciate
both contributions of circuits for new problems, as well as circuits with
that make different tradeoffs on the various performance metrics. Please try
and give your circuits helpful names. Longer is often better.
